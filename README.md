# Kent Notasyonu (City Notation)

Kent Notasyonu is a web-based application that transforms urban textures into musical compositions. Inspired by the work of Delfin Gunay Ercan, this project aims to provide a unique auditory perspective on urban morphology.

## Description

This application analyzes urban textures, particularly focusing on road networks and intersections, and converts them into musical notations. By doing so, it offers a novel way to perceive and understand city structures through sound.

## Features

-   Interactive map interface for selecting urban areas
-   Analysis of road networks and intersections
-   Conversion of urban textures to musical notations
-   Playback of generated music
-   Visualization of the notation process

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cansakirt/kent-notasyonu.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Use the map interface to select a neighborhood or urban area.
3. Adjust the music parameters as desired.
4. Click the "Play" button to listen to the generated music based on the selected urban texture.
